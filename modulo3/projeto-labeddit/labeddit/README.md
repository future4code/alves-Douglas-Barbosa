### Link

- https://better-pump.surge.sh/

### Objective

- Application made with the intention of reproducing the fundamentals of the social network Reddit . It contains features such as account creation, login, posts, upvote and downvote system.

### What Works

- Based on LabEddit [API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/9731983/U16eu7nT)
- Like or Dislike system
- JWT Token verification
- Create your post and make your comments
- Dark Mode included (using Global State)
- Pagination using a scroll system (just like Reddit)
- Mobile First Application

### Languages, frameworks and libraries used

- React, JavaScript, HTML, Styled Components, Axios, React-Router-Dom and Figma.

### What I learned

- With this project, I was reinforced the concepts of using an API to guarantee user interactivity. Developing a Darkmode for the first time was something I really enjoyed as well.
