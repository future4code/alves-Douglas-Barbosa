- Application made with the intention of understanding, applying and positioning the logic concepts of the relationship application Tinder. Following just a few pre-defined objectives such as a Like and Dislike functionality, in addition to a screen for displaying Matches.


### What works

- Like or Dislike system
- Card swipe animations
- Search Bar
- Reset Matches
- Designed to mobile devices

### Languages, frameworks ​​and libraries used

- React, JavaScript, HTML, Styled Components, Axios, [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/DVxS3ujfqRVWOFpygAIzZC/AstroMatch-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1) e Toast lib.

### What I learned

- With this project I improved my notion of layouts a lot, mainly because I used Figma intuitively for the first time. The concept of conditional rendering was used a lot both directly and indirectly to avoid bugs, including one that gave me a lot of work related to the data coming from the API. The implementation of the swipe animations was also a good learning experience and was achieved with the exchange with some colleagues, a right step in learning Css animations, which is something I really enjoy and appreciate.
